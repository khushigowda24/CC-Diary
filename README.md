# CC-Diary
The Course Coordinator Diary is a web-based application designed to streamline the management of course-related information, specifically tailored for course coordinators. Developed using JavaScript, PHP, MySQL, CSS, and HTML, the system addresses key administrative tasks by providing features for internal marks management, question paper storage, and assignment and quiz tracking. It facilitates the secure entry and updating of assessment scores, automates the calculation of internal marks, and generates detailed mark sheets in Excel and PDF formats. Additionally, the application supports the definition of course-specific outcomes and collects feedback from students on faculty and course effectiveness.The primary objective of this project is to enhance the efficiency, accessibility, and organization of course management processes. By offering a comprehensive and user-friendly interface, the Course Coordinator Diary improves data accuracy, ensures transparent assessment practices, and fosters better communication between faculty and students. This project not only simplifies administrative tasks but also provides valuable insights for improving the educational experience.
